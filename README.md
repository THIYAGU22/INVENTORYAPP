# PROJECT-10-ABND-INVENTORY-APP
The goal is to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products.
The app will store information about price, quantity available, supplier, and a picture of the product. 
It will allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.
